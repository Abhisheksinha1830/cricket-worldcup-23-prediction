The "Cricket ODI World Cup-23 Prediction" is an exciting data science project that aims to predict the outcomes of matches in the 2023 Cricket One Day International (ODI) World Cup. This project leverages the power of machine learning and data analysis techniques to forecast the results of upcoming matches, making it a valuable tool for cricket enthusiasts, fans, and analysts alike.

## Dataset
Results of the ODI matches since 1970 and 2023 were taken from kaggle, and other dataset is taken from official ICC Cricket website.

## Project Flow

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The project starts with collecting historical cricket match data for previous ODI matches.This data 
   is then meticulously preprocessed to handle missing values, clean inconsistencies, and extract relevant 
   features for predictive modeling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the cricket data and uncover patterns, 
   trends, and relationships between different variables. EDA provides a foundation for making informed decisions about the machine 
   learning approach and feature selection.

3. Feature Engineering: The project includes advanced feature engineering techniques to derive new meaningful features from the raw data, 
   which is crucial in improving the accuracy and performance of the predictive models.

4. Model Building: Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared to determine the best-performing model for match 
   outcome prediction. Algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting were explored to find the most suitable 
   model but Random forest outperformes all other models with Training set and Testing set accuracy at 76% and 75% respetively  

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: To further enhance model performance, hyperparameter tuning techniques like Randomized Search 
   are employed to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model.

6. Model Evaluation: The predictive models are evaluated using accuracy metric

7. Continuous Improvement: The project is expected to evolve over time, incorporating new data, updating models, and incorporating new 
   features to improve accuracy and ensure predictions are as accurate as possible.

### According to this model Australia is likely to win World Cup 2023

Overall, by combining the power of data science, machine learning, and cricket expertise, the project aims to enhance the excitement and engagement around the Cricket ODI World Cup-23 by providing insightful predictions for all cricket lovers.
